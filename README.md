# Interactive Cube with STM32

A customizable and programmable device to aid research groups in efficiently testing the effects of fidget toys on individuals with ADHD and improving data collection.

Built to be compatible with the 6 sides of the cube with the following modules/panels:

## Modules:
The six panels of the toy housing are divided into separate “modules” as follows:
Bottom panel (closest to the stadium cutout):
Shall be kept free of any protrusions or unsmooth surfaces to provide a stable base for the toy to rest on
Aesthetic choices such as a coat of paint may be applied provided they are smooth and do not violate the previous specification

**Side panel 1:**
ONE large, user-interactable, and reachable toggle style switch
THREE LEDs of colors Red, Green, and Blue, respectively
The three LEDs shall blink one after each other according to TWO user-definable variables: the length of the blink, and the amount of time between one LED blink and the next, when the user activates the toggle switch

**Side panel 2:**
ONE user interactable push button
ONE Direct Current (DC) motor connected to a tactile, no bigger than the diameter of the motor, object
Only the push button shall activate the spinning of the motor at a user-definable speed

**Side panel 3:**
ONE user interactable slider switch
ONE haptic/vibration motor
The activation/deactivation of the slider switch shall activate/deactivate the haptic motor

**Side panel 4:**
ONE user interactable (via shaking) vibration switch
THREE LEDs of colors Red, Green, and Blue respectively
The three LEDs shall only activate when the user shakes the toy with enough force to activate the vibration switch
Top panel (opposite the stadium cutouts):
Shall only be covered and be fully covered by a user-interactable and tactile material of no more than 2 inches thick
